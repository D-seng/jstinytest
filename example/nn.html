Simple model = essentialist model.
Essentialism = see the "essence" and call it reality.
Essence = I see it or intuit it, therefore it's the most important thing. The world is constructed of essences.
Essentialism appeals to authority because it's a veiled way to say something is so becasue I say so.
Science says we almost certainly don't see what's important because the world of unknowns grows exponentially with the knowns. It puts the "leaks" at the philosophical center. This is why good science starts with good questions, which are questions that focus on leaks we can reach.
Therefore, science is the defeat of essentialism.
This is why science, especially social science, is an affront to authority. This is why freedom and science arrived on the scene together.
